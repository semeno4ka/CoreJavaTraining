package day29_Inheritance;

public class Inheritance {
    /*
    Inheritance is a precondition for abstraction and polymorphism to exist
    when one class has all the characteristics of another class(parent-child)
    animal->cat->dog
    Are great for classes that have same - common features that can be inherited
    all the unique characteristics will be specified in their own class, not common
    Parent treats all the child classes equally. All the features if parent class are
    automatically applied to all child classes

    Inheritance creates "is-a" relationship
    Dog "is-a" animal / cat "is-a" animal etc

    Inherits all methods and variables

    public class Dog extends Animal{
    // the way you create a relationship - child class EXTENDS parent class
    }


    Private variables and methods are not inherited
    Constructors are not inherited. Child Class MUST CALL one of the parent's constructor.
    Since constructors must have same names as class name it cannot be animal and dog at the same time.


    For now, we'll use public for variables to better understand inheritance.
    Later on we'll use encapsulation with private

    Parent Class exists only for creating child classes
