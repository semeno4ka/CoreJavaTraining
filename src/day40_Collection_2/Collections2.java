    QUEUE (Least used data Structure). The only time you need it is when you have to delete Objects in FIFO order
    - child interface of Collection
    - allows duplicates
    - Insertion order not preserved, no INDEX NUMBERS
    - First-In, First-Out(FIFO) -.poll() returns and removes the 1 added object


PriorityQueue:
- implements Queue interface
- maintains random order
- does not accept NULL

Deque:
1. ArrayDeque:(Implicitly uses Array, but doesn't have access to Index), for internal use only
- implements The Deque Interface
- maintains insertion order
- does not accept NULL

2.LinkedList:
- Implements both List and Queue, hence has INDEX number
- accepts Null
- keep insertion order
